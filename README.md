# Mickey's Machine Learning Lab

Welcome to Mickey's Machine Learning Lab! This is an interactive web application built using Streamlit that offers users the capability to upload datasets, perform some basic exploratory data analysis, and then train machine learning models. The application provides a seamless interface for users to quickly understand their data and experiment with various machine learning algorithms without diving deep into code.
Features

## Data Uploading:
Users can easily upload their datasets in CSV format, with a preview option available to quickly glance at the initial rows of the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
### The application provides users with general statistics about the dataset, including features like:
Data shape (number of rows and columns)

Descriptive statistics (like mean, median, etc.)

Display of null values in the dataset

Data type of each column

## Machine Learning Model Training:
LazyPredict Integration: The centerpiece of this lab is its ability to use LazyPredict, which allows users to quickly train and benchmark multiple algorithms to find the best fit for their dataset. Both classification and regression models from LazyPredict are supported.
